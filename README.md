I have configured the chainlit

chainlit run main.py

You will need to install some dependency, i forgot which one i installed, so terminal will guide you about these, do add them in requirements.txt file after you install.

Chats are sent and received, ai is querying the db as well, but the problem is with prompt, refine that please, thanks.
